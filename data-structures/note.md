# Basic Data Structures
## Arrays
- Random access means that we can access items based on their indexes in O(1) constant running time because the items are right next to each other in the memory.
- Manipulate the last item (insertion or removal): O(1) running time
- Manipulate arbitrary item (insertion or removal): O(n) running time

## Linked Lists
- Dynamic data structures: can acquire memory at run-time by inserting new nodes.
- Insert items at the beginning of the data structure fast: O(1) running time.
- Insert items at the end: O(n).
