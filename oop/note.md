# Object-Oriented Programming in Java
- Java: mostly used for enterprise-level and Android software development
- The basic entities in object-oriented programming are classes and objects.
- Divide a complex program into a bunch of objects talking to each other.
## Anatomy of Objects and Classes
- Objects have state and behavior --> "where do these objects come from?"
- A `Class` can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects.
- The state of the objects is generally modeled using variables in class and the behavior is modeled by implementing the methods.
